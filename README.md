This is stock-management system made by Afif Mansib Chowdhury(6028129)

The functionality of this app includes a webpage that can be used to keep track of many suppliers. Initially the page is loaded with a registration form through which i can save name, adress and phone number of suppliers. Once saved, these suppliers appear on a table. The details of suppliers are saved in the MONGODB database. It is a reflection of The CRUD operation. However, Everything is functional other than the update functiopnality. 

There is an additional functionality to varify a supplier using name and adress also that was not required.
